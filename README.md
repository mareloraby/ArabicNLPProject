# Breif overview
this project compares the performance of multiple BERT-based models for the task of Emotion recognition in Arabic Tweets.
Our approach compares 7 BERT models:
1. AraBERT-base
2. AraBERT-Twitter-base 
3. MARBERT
4. CAMELBERT-DA
5. CAMELBERT-MSA
6. CAMELBERT-MSA-16th
7. mBERT

All the experiments are avaialble in [/Experiments](Experiments Directory). The model that achieved the highest accuracy is MARBERT. Its notebook is available in [/MARBERT.ipynb] with added inference examples in the end.
